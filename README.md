## LockAssignment

**LockAssignment** is a raid utility addon for **World of Warcraft Vanilla (1.12)** that helps manage warlock responsibilities in 40-man raids.

It provides a centralized way to assign **curses**, **banish targets**, and **soulstone recipients**, reducing coordination overhead during raids.

Inspired by the original [NeverLocky](https://github.com/JohnImboden/NeverLocky).
